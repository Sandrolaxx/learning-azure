# Roulette Game

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a roulette game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a rotating roulette wheel and a bouncing ball that follows the laws of physics. The goal is to provide an engaging and visually appealing experience for users.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the roulette game. It includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files and contains the canvas element for rendering the roulette wheel and ball.
